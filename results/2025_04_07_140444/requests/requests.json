Managers are elected to make sure that\nemployees have all the processes, resources, and information they need to\nprovide services to clients in an efficient manner. Any manager up to the CEO\nis visible and reachable for a chat regardless of their title. Decisions are\ntaken with a consent in an agile manner and executed efficiently in no overdue\ntime. We accept that wrong decisions happen and we appreciate the learning\nbefore we adjust the process for a continuous improvement. Employees serve\nclients. Employees listen attentively to client needs and collaborate\ninternally as a team to cater to them. Managers and employees work together to\nget things done and are accountable to each other. Corporate KPIs are\ntransparently reviewed on monthly company events with all employees.\n\n**Performance Driven Compensation**\n\nWe recognize and accept that some of us are more ambitious, more gifted, or\nmore hard-working. We also recognize that some of us look for a stable income\nand lesser hassle at a different stage of their careers. There is a place for\neveryone, we embrace and need this diversity. Grades in our company are not\nbased on number of years of experience, they are value driven based on\neveryone’s ability to deliver independently their work to clients and/or lead\nothers. There is no “anniversary/annual” bonus, we distribute bonuses on a\nmonthly recurring basis as an instant gratification for performance and this\nbonus is practically unlimited. There is no “annual indexation” of salaries,\nyou may be upgraded several times within the year, or none, based on your own\npace of progress, ambitions, relevant skillset and recognition by clients\n\n**Work-Life Integration**\n\nWe challenge the notion of work-life balance, we embrace the notion of work-\nlife integration instead. This philosophy looks into our lives as a single\nwhole where we serve ourselves, our families and our clients in an integrated\nmanner. We encourage 100% flexible working hours where you arrange your day.\nThis means you are free when you have little work, but this also means extra\neffort if you are behind schedule. Working on a Western project also means\nnobody bothers you during the whole day but you may have to jump on a scrum\ncall in the evening to talk to your team overseas. We appreciate time and we\nminimize time spent on Adastra meetings. We are also a remote-first company.\nWhile we have our collaboration offices and social events, we encourage people\nto work 100% remote from home whenever possible. This means saving time and\nmoney on commute, staying home with elderly and little ones, not missing the\nspecial moments in life. This also means you can work from any of our other\noffices in Europe, North America or Australia, or move to a place with lower\ncost of living without impacting your income. We trust you by default until\nyou fail our trust.\n\n**Global Diversity**\n\nAdastra Thailand is an international organization. We hire globally and our\nbiggest partners and clients are in Europe, North America and Australia. We\nwork on teams with individuals from different culture, ethnicity, sexual\npreference, political views or religion. We have zero tolerance to anyone who\ndoesn’t pay respect to others or is abusive in any way. We speak different\nlanguages to one another, but we speak English when we are together or with\nclients. Our company is a safe space where communication is encouraged but\nboundaries regarding sensitive topics are respected. We accept and converge\ntogether to serve our teams and clients and ultimately have good time at work.\n\n**Lifelong Learning**\n\nOn annual average we invest 25% of our working hours to personal development\nand upskilling outside project work, regardless of seniority or role. We\nfeature more than 400 courses on our Training Repo and we continue to actively\npurchase or tailor hands-on content. We certify people on our expense. We like\nto say we are technology agnostic; we learn the principles of data management\nand we apply it on different use cases and different technology stacks. We\nbelieve that the juniors today are the seniors tomorrow, we treat everyone\nwith respect and mentor them into the roles they deserve. We encourage seniors\nto give back to the IT community through leadership and mentorship. On your\nlast day with us we may give you an open dated job offer so that you feel\nwelcome to return home as others did before you.\n\nMore About Adastra:\n\nVisit Thailand | Adastra (adastracorp.com)and/or contact us: at HRTH@adastragrp.com \n\n and identify all relevant skills, categorized into hard skills and soft skills in a comprehensive manner.\n\nThe extracted skill names must follow standardized naming conventions to ensure consistency and usability for analysis across multiple job postings.
